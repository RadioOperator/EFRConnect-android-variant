# EFR Connect Mobile Application


## Overview

The Silicon Labs EFR Connect app utilizes the Bluetooth adapter on your phone/tablet to scan, connect and interact with BLE devices.

The app is divided into two main functional areas, the demo and the develop view.

The demo view lists a number of demos that are meant for quickly testing some of the sample apps in the Silicon Labs Bluetooth SDK. The currently supported demos are:

- **Health Thermometer demo:** Connects to an EFR32/BGM device running the soc-thermometer sample application from the Bluetooth SDK and displays the temperature read from the SI7021 sensor on the WSTK mainboard.
- **Connected Lighting DMP demo:** Leverages the DMP sample apps to control a DMP light node from both a mobile app as well as the protocol specific switch node (Zigbee, proprietary) while keeping the light status in sync across all devices. 
- **Range Test demo:** Allows visualizing the RSSI and other RF performance data on the mobile phone while running Range Test sample application on a pair of Silicon Labs radio boards.

The develop view contains functionalities focused on helping developers create and troubleshoot their Bluetooth applications based on EFR32/BGM devices. The currently supported functionalities are:

- **Bluetooth Browser:** This is a generic and powerful tool that allows you to explore the BLE devices around you. Key features of the browser include:
  - Scan and sort results with rich data set
    - Connectable/non-connectable
    - Beacon type
    - Advertisement interval
    - RSSI
    - Bluetooth address

  - Advanced filtering options to quickly identify the devices you want
    - Device name
    - Raw advertisement data
    - RSSI
    - Beacon type (iBeacon, Eddystone, AltBeacon)
    - Favorites only
    - Connectable only
  - Option to save filters for later use
  - Support for multiple connections
  - Support for Bluetooth 5 advertising extensions
  - Ability to rename services/characteristics with 128-bit UUIDs (mappings dictionary)
  - Over-the-air (OTA) device firmware upgrade (DFU) with both reliable and speed modes
  - Configurable MTU and connection interval
  - Support for all GATT operations
- **Bluetooth Advertiser:** Allows you to create multiple advertisement sets and enable them in parallel
  - Supports legacy and extended advertising
  - Configurable advertisement interval, TX Power, primary/secondary PHYs
  - Ability to manually start/stop advertisement, or stop based on time/event limit
  - Support for multiple AD types
